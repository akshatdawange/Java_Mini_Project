# Java Mini Project
We have developed an application with a questionnaire which helps students to get a clarity of what 
stream should they opt for after their class 10th. This shall help students to choose their 
stream for junior college. This was used for submission of mini project in 2nd year of undergraduation at MIT WPU, Pune for Java Programming Course
